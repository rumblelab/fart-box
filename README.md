Parts List with (some) affiliate links. This is what I used, but you can absolutely use other components.

The muscle: MG90s servo
Don't skimp here. You want a "strong" metal gear servo. https://amzn.to/477yneG

For the linkage I used machine screws and mending plates that you can find in the hardware section at lowes.

I also used a servo pushrod that I had laying around:

I am sure there are more effienct ways to recreate this 5 years later. You could probably simplify and cheapen things a bit with an arduino uno and a mosfet. 

The prop maker and feather really is nice for keeping the package small. Plus the propmaker has the ampacity(word?) and memory to handle driving the servos and save the audio file/power the speaker.
